## üî¨ Technical Details

### Physics Model

The application implements sophisticated aerodynamic calculations:

#### Basic Glide Equation
```
Glide Distance = (Altitude / 6076) √ó L/D √ó (Ground Speed / Airspeed)
```

#### Configuration Effects
- **Clean Configuration**: 100% L/D efficiency
- **Gear Extended**: 70% L/D efficiency  
- **Flaps 10¬∞**: 85% L/D efficiency
- **Flaps 20¬∞**: 75% L/D efficiency
- **Full Configuration**: 60% L/D efficiency

#### Bank Angle Effects
```
Effective L/D = Base L/D √ó cos(bank angle)
```
- 30¬∞ bank = 15% increase in sink rate
- 45¬∞ bank = 30% increase in sink rate

#### Density Altitude Corrections
```
True Airspeed = Indicated Airspeed √ó ‚àö(œÅ‚ÇÄ/œÅ)
```
Where œÅ is air density at altitude
